Data pointer flashes unnecessarily when computer is reset.

Cannot visually see which command currently being executed by computer.

Memory values too narrow, jump on screen when more digits are needed.

Buttons need to be moved to correct locations.

Need method to load/save code for later use.

Advancing to next instruction does not skip comment code and probably should.

Need indicator in memory block to show which location data pointer is pointing to.

Memory locations no longer flashing yellow when data is changed.

Lines in code too long for git sites.  Trim to fewer characters.
