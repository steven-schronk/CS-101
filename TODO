Data pointer flashes unnecessarily when computer is reset.

Need method to load/save code for later use.

Advancing to next instruction does not skip comment code and probably should.

Memory locations no longer flashing yellow when data is changed more than once.

Bottom line on memory table missing.

When in run mode, a SEGFAULT will cause an endless loop.

First column of Memory table wider than other columns.

Need better pointer character for data pointer in memory area.
