Need method to load/save code for later use.

Memory locations no longer flashing yellow when data is changed more than once.

Bottom line on memory table missing.

When in run mode, a SEGFAULT will cause an endless loop.

First column of Memory table wider than other columns.

Need better pointer character for data pointer in memory area.

Not displaying HALT message when in run mode. Caused by loop skipping comments.
